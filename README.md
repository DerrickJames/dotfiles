# dotfiles
Vim, tmux, command line tools and native apps setup for my toolbox.

Be sure to check out <https://dotfiles.github.io/> for some motivation.

##### Warning
Don't use my settings blindly unless you've reviewed the code and changed what
you feel might not work for you.

### Installation

Be sure to back up your dotfiles and configurations.
Run the following commands on your terminal.
* `git clone https://github.com/DerrickJames/dotfiles.git`
* `cd dotfiles`
* `sh bootstrap.sh`
* Install all the vim & tmux packages, check in the respective configuration
  files. Will generate a list soon.
* Bum, you're looking good like a ninja.

This repo is a work in progress and it keeps changing depending on my personal
preferences.
